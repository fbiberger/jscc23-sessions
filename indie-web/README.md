# Introduction to the Indie Web

- The IndieWeb is a movement and set of principles that promote the idea of owning and controlling your online presence.
- It encourages the use of open web standards and decentralized technologies to foster a more inclusive, user-centric internet experience.

I'm passionate about the IndieWeb movement because I've becomed unsatisfied how the [Social Media](https://indieweb.org/social_media) platforms have affected the internet.
